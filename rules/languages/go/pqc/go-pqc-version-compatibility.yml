    message: Go version dependency detected - verify PQC support availability (Go 1.24+ required for ML-KEM)
    severity: INFO
    languages:
      - go
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          # Runtime version checks that might be version-sensitive
          - pattern: runtime.Version()
    metadata:
      category: pqc_readiness
      cwe: CWE-327
      impact: Go versions prior to 1.24 lack ML-KEM support, creating potential compatibility issues when PQC is enabled in mixed-version environments
      remediation: Ensure all components in the system support the same minimum Go version with PQC capabilities
